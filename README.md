# mobio-facial-analysis

## [NOTE: This repo is a WIP. Will be continuing cleanup and documentation throughout this week.]

There are two main submodules in this repo. 
- `mediapipe` contains the code for running the demo on Android and C++. The Android demo is the same as last term, the code hasn't been updated. I've started putting together a standalone demo in C++ to make integration easier. This is still ongoing, and I'm hoping to wrap it up by the end of this week.
- `MediaPipeUnityPlugin` contains demo code for building and running the demo in Unity and to deploy it on Android/iOS devices.
